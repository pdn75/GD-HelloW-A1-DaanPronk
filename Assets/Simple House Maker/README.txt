Thank you for downloading this house building package.

You can use this asset for any of your projects.
If you comment my name or package (and url) in the game/asset/package you are making, I thank you very much, but it is up to you.

An asset with this complexity will (almost) never be perfect (also because of the various places it can be used). Since there is no point to hate each other, if you or someone has a problem with this product,
please reach me, and I will remove the bug, as soon as possible or write down how to use it correctly to work fine.
Happy developing!

(You should also reach me, if something is not obvious enough to understand. ('Cause that means, that other people won't understand also))
